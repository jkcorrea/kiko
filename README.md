# Next Shopify Starter

The purpose of this project is to provide a template for creating a headless Shopify store using Next.js. It was constructed with a few baseline components and some key functionality for creating a store out of the box. It was intended to be simplistic and allow for users to build upon themselves. Some key features are:

- Creating collection and product pages
- Creating and logging in customers and handling tokens
- Adding and removing items from the cart
- Creating a checkout and directing a user to a Shopify checkout
- Using Shopify's Storefront GraphQL API to interact with your Shopify store

The project does have some opinions on tooling to be aware of. These include:

- The use of Styled Components
- The use of Recompose
- The use of Prismic as a separate CMS (This can _very_ easily be changed)
